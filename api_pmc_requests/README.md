WARNING:
This module was implemented by @erdenirf (https://github.com/erdenirf).
It was added explicitly to RAI in order to maintain compatibility of all modules, that use PMCR (PMCRequester class).
It will be removed as soon as api_pmc_requests will be published as pip package by @erdenirf 
and will be replaced by basic Python library import.
RAI does not aim at stealing your intellectual property.
